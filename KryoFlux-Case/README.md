KryoFlux Case
=============

Laser cutting files for an external housing for the KryoFlux universal floppy controller,
a 3.5" floppy drive, a 5.25" (half-height) floppy drive, power brick and panel-mount USB
and IEC power connectors. Based on the oomlout Open Building Block (OOBB) system
https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout-OOBB. Tested cut into MDF, should be suitable for
acrylic cutting. Requires various screws and bolts; full BoM to be added when I get a chance.
